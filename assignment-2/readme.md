MY [RESPONSES](/assignment-2/responses.txt)

This assignment was very enjoyable for me. The pace of information was easy to keep up with and everything was explained/demonstrated fully. I really like having lessons I can directly follow along with, and having constant assignments within Atom gives me a lot of hand-on time with the software.
