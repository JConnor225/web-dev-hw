I. One example of data travelling across the internet is video streaming.
A stream of data leaves a server, and that data can be accessed with a plugin
as part of a web browser(Netflix and Hulu use Silverlight).
II. All things connected to the internet have an IP address. IP addresses are
simply numerical though, and the Domain Name System connects domain names (google.com)
to their IP addresses.
III. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's computer by a website.
These can be used to give personalized information on a webpage.
IV. The three parts of a URL are: the domain name, the protocol and the path.
