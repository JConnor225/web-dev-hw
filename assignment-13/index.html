        <i>â€œEloquently tracing the birth of a revolutionary, Huey P. Newton's famous
        and oft-quoted autobiography is as much a manifesto as a portrait of the inner
        circle of America's Black Panther Party. From Newton's impoverished childhood on
        the streets of Oakland to his adolescence and struggles with the system, from his
        role in the Black Panthers to his solitary confinement in the Alameda County Jail,
        Revolutionary Suicide is smart, unrepentant, and thought-provoking in its portrayal
        of inspired radicalism."</i> -jacket cover, Writer and Readers Publishing 1996
