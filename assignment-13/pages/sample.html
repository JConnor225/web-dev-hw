    <h1 align="center" class="main-heading">Excerpts from Revolutionary Suicide</h1>
    <p align="center" class="content"> <i>"Revolutionary suicide does not mean that I and
      my comrades have a death wish; it means just the opposite. We have such a strong desire
      to live with hope and human dignity that existence without them is impossible. When reactionary
      forces crush us, we must move against these forces, even at the risk of death. We will have to
      be driven out with a stick." </i> -Huey Newton</p>
      <br>
      <p align="center" class="content"><i>"I do not think that life will change for the better without an assault on the Establishment, which
      goes on exploiting the wretched of the earth. This belief lies at the heart of the concept of revolutionary
      suicide. Thus it is better to oppose the forces that would drive me to self-murder than to endure them. Although
      I risk the likelihood of death, there is at least the possibility, if not the probability, of changing intolerable
      conditions. This possibility is important, because much in human existence is based upon hope without any real
      understanding of the odds."</i> -Huey Newton</p>
      <br>
      <p align="center" class="content"><i>“In the metaphysical sense we based the expression "All Power to the People" on
        the idea of man as God. I have no other God but man, and I firmly believe that man is the highest or chief good. If
        you are obligated to be true and honest to anyone, it is to your God, and if each man is God, then you must be true
        to him. If you believe that man is the ultimate being, then you will act according to your belief. Your attitude and
        behaviour toward man is a kind of religion in itself, with high standards of responsibility.” </i> -Huey Newton</p>
