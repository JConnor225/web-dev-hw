# ASSIGNMENT 5 README
- In HTML, a page can only one head and body element. The head element serves to tell the page information about the content within it and how to display it properly. The body contains all the visible elements of the page to an external user.
- I'm enjoying continuing to work in HTML and gaining more knowledge with each assignment. The work this week was not difficult to accomplish once I read through the class website, and all the topics from the reading carried over to the assignment in an applicable way.
- Structural markup helps visually format a page using line breaks, paragraphs etc. Semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of certain words or phrases, using italics, parentheses and underlines.
