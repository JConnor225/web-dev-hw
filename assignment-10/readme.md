*What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?* Web-safe fonts are fonts designed for use on the internet and are thus compatible with every system automatically. Web fonts are fonts that are accessed when the webpage loads, typically from Google or Adobe font kits. System fonts are third-party fonts loaded into the webpage locally. 

*What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?* Having fallback fonts or a font stack ensures that every user of your webpage will be able to see the text, in case your primary font is not compatible with their system.

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.* This was a section of web design that I was curious about so I'm glad we went over it in this section. There are so many small adjustments that can be made in terms of alignment, size, margin etc. Understanding those pieces allows the designer to make the page more readable and aesthetically pleasing.
