# ASSIGNMENT 6 TECHNICAL REPORT
1. Forms are used all across the web in many different forms. One of the most common uses for forms is in online chopping, where it used to collect shipping and billing info from customers.
2. Text input would be for username or password collection. Button input would be selecting from multiple choices by pikcing a button. Selection uses a dropdown to choose from numerous choices.
3. I found this assignment much more straight-forward and based on utility. I enjoyed this somewhat but I also enjoy doing more design based work, so this was an interesting departure for me.
