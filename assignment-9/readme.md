*Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?* A universal selector is used to apply styling to the entire page. An element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type, such as headings. Class and ID are increasingly specific selectors that allow the designer to group particular elements of the page together and apply styling to them.

*Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.* I chose to use a very bright and vibrant color palette for this assignment. I used e7228c pink and 3AB1FC blue for the primaries.

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.* I enjoyed working with color this week and CSS seems to be he part of web design focused on visuals. I feel that I'm a very visual learner and working with very visual elements was certainly welcome.
