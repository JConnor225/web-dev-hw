<h1>JAMES SANDEFUR</h1>
This week I created an HTML page and learned about the basic elements of HTML. The head usually contains five elements. These are the Meta, Viewport, Title, Link and Style elements. However, there is typically only 1 head element within a page. There also is usually only one body element on a page.
