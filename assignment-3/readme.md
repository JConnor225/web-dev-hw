  <li>Browsers are applications that allow an internet-connected device to access the Web. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are the two browsers I use on a regular basis.
  <li>Structural markup contains information about a document that breaks the text into paragraphs, headers etc. Semantic markup is used for more subtle changes to the text of the document-usually bold or italics to emphasize a particular word.
